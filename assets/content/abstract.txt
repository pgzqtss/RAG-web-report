Medical research plays a crucial role in healthcare. It helps doctors to find the optimal treatments at that point and also assisting medical professionals seeking out new and better ways of preventing, diagnosing and treating disease. So, staying updated to those research papers is highly recommended in the medical industry, no matter whether you are a doctor, a nurse or a healthcare worker. However, reading a large amount of research papers is time consuming. There’s a paper from BMC Nursing state the reflections from Registered Nurses about how difficult and time-consuming reading research literature is. Also, they need to relate their strategies for extracting the meaning, as they understood it, from the papers they read. ​[1]​  

Reading and studying research is important yet overwhelming. To help this situation, we are now bringing in an application that can retrieve the key insights for up to 50 medical papers in the same thematic field, and generate a 5-6 pages long systematic review.  

With this application, it hugely shortens the time used in reading and analyzing, saving up more time for actual treatment or discovery. Also, saving time could greatly contribute to better decision making, especially in high pressure environments like A&E. This allows medical professionals to focus more on impactful and life-saving work, while staying informed and up to date.
